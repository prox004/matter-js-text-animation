# Matter.Js Text Animation

A simple falling text animation created using Matter.js. This effect is used in my Portfolio site. Feel free to edit the words and apply on your site.



## Editing

Open the index.html and edit using any editor.

```bash
  nano index.html
```
Edit the following lines inside the <script> tag to add your own words.

```html
    let wordsToDisplay = [
                "Photoshop",
                "Illustrator",
                "Figma",
                "Branding",
                "Design",
                "Logo",
                "UI/UX",
                "Web Design",
                "Graphic Design",  
                "Development",
                "Frontend",
                "HTML",
                "CSS",

                "React",
